Time Complexity Analysis

1. Initializing the Data Structures
Method: Autocorrect(String[] words, int threshold)

Time Complexity:
Trie Construction: Inserting each word into the Trie takes
O(L) time per word, where L is the average length of the word.
For N words, this results in a total time complexity of O(N⋅L).

Candidate Sorting: The method loops through each word and hashes every two-gram in the word.
For each word, this involves L−2 iterations, where L is the length of the word.
Since hashing is O(1), the total time complexity for this operation is O(N⋅L), where N is the number of words in the dictionary.

2. Generating All Matching Candidates for a Given Misspelled Word
Method: chooseCandidates(String typed)

Time Complexity:

Two-Gram Hashing: The method loops through the characters of the input word and generates two-grams.
The time complexity is O(L), where L is the length of the typed word.

Candidate Selection: For each two-gram, the algorithm adds candidates from the sorted list based on the hash.
The candidate selection could involve iterating through all possible candidates for each two-gram.
In the worst case, this could be O(C), where C is the number of candidates for each two-gram.
Therefore, the overall complexity of this method is O(L⋅C),
where L is the length of the word and C is the average number of candidates for a given two-gram.

3. Edit Distance
Method: editDistance(String typed, String word)

Time Complexity:

The edit distance calculation uses dynamic programming (tabulation).
Since the cells of the table are filled in constant time, the time is proportional to the size of the table.
The size of the table is XY, where X and Y are the lengths of the words.
Therefore, the time complexity is O(X⋅Y).

4. Other Major Components
Trie Lookup: O(L), where L is the length of the word being checked.

Removing Candidate Duplicates: The candidates are stored in a LinkedHashSet to remove duplicates.
The time complexity for this is O(C), where C is the number of candidates to process.

Overall Time Complexity
Initial Setup (Dictionary Loading and Trie Construction):
O(N⋅L), where N is the number of words and L is the average word length.

Generating Candidates:
O(L⋅C), where L is the length of the typed word and C is the number of candidates per two-gram.

Edit Distance Calculation:
O(X⋅Y), where X and Y are the lengths of the typed word and the candidate word.
