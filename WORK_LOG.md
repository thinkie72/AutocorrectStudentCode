| March 5  |   2:30-3pm    |                                                                                      I thought about ways to sort the candidates with Caden. We first envisioned that we could take the words and filter them based on a host of factors. Then, we thought about all the possible ways to edit a word but then realized we would have explosive runtime. |
| March 7  | 12:45-1:45pm  |                                                           Still no code here, but we began a new approach. With the help of Mr. Blick, we figured that k-grams (2-grams in this case) could help us sort words because we could automatically remove the need to edit k letters in a word. I think this will work, but there may be some more speed ups. |
| March 14 |  8:55-9:55am  |                                            I began coding this version to work for finding the edit distance of all the words, which works but has explosive runtime. It mostly works, I need to work out a few kinks before it passes all the test cases. Once I get this done, I'll implement the input stream and begin working on a faster approach. |
| March 17 |     2-3pm     | I figured out how to finish passing all the text cases by sorting each array alphabetically. I began thinking about what more to do. I know I need a main method and a simple front end to run this, as well as a trie to hold the dictionary to quickly check if something is a word. Other than that, I still need to implement the k-gram strategy... |
| March 19 | 12:40-1:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                   I made a simple front end and a main method to start making autocorrect past the test cases. I also made a trie to hold the dictionary. I still need to run some candidate filters with the k-grams... |
| March 21 | 10:55-11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                         I started building a few pieces to start building k-grams and candidates. I still need to fully implement the approach and data structures. Here goes nothing... |
| March 24 |   8:30-9pm    |                                                               There's a lot of confusion here. I started instantiating the array and fully transforming the initial constructor, parameters, and instance variables. I'm still working to complete the hashing for the two-grams and instantiating the candidates, cause it should be easy from there... |
