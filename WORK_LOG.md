| March 5  |   2:30-3pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I thought about ways to sort the candidates with Caden. We first envisioned that we could take the words and filter them based on a host of factors. Then, we thought about all the possible ways to edit a word but then realized we would have explosive runtime. |
| March 7  | 12:45-1:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Still no code here, but we began a new approach. With the help of Mr. Blick, we figured that k-grams (2-grams in this case) could help us sort words because we could automatically remove the need to edit k letters in a word. I think this will work, but there may be some more speed ups. |
| March 14 |  8:55-9:55am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                    I began coding this version to work for finding the edit distance of all the words, which works but has explosive runtime. It mostly works, I need to work out a few kinks before it passes all the test cases. Once I get this done, I'll implement the input stream and begin working on a faster approach. |
| March 17 |     2-3pm     |                                                                                                                                                         I figured out how to finish passing all the text cases by sorting each array alphabetically. I began thinking about what more to do. I know I need a main method and a simple front end to run this, as well as a trie to hold the dictionary to quickly check if something is a word. Other than that, I still need to implement the k-gram strategy... |
| March 19 | 12:40-1:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I made a simple front end and a main method to start making autocorrect past the test cases. I also made a trie to hold the dictionary. I still need to run some candidate filters with the k-grams... |
| March 21 | 10:55-11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I started building a few pieces to start building k-grams and candidates. I still need to fully implement the approach and data structures. Here goes nothing... |
| March 24 |   8:30-9pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       There's a lot of confusion here. I started instantiating the array and fully transforming the initial constructor, parameters, and instance variables. I'm still working to complete the hashing for the two-grams and instantiating the candidates, cause it should be easy from there... |
| March 24 |   9-9:30pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I did some more work toward the final product here. I think I figured out how to find the candidates and choose them based on the typed word. I need to make it work with the other stuff now. |
| March 24 | 9:30-10:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                  A longer commit time here so I'll give a longer message. I think it mostly works. I need to figure out some kinks with nulls and such but I feel pretty close. I got the candidates algorithm probably right and the other stuff close. I hope I can finish this soon with a product I love (and one I can show to my friends). |
| March 24 | 10:30-11:45pm | I finished! It works really well and I just removed a few cases and worked out some kinks to make it work. I took so long between this commit and the last one because I also did commenting and the FINALVERSION.md file. I was just in the zone and wanted to get it done by midnight. I think I really improved as a coder on this project and learned how to think about the intersection of so many complicated ideas to form something that seemed super simple. I'm really happy with where I ended up... |
