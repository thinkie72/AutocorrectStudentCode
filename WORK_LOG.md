| March 5  |   2:30-3pm   |                                           I thought about ways to sort the candidates with Caden. We first envisioned that we could take the words and filter them based on a host of factors. Then, we thought about all the possible ways to edit a word but then realized we would have explosive runtime. |
| March 7  | 12:45-1:45pm |                Still no code here, but we began a new approach. With the help of Mr. Blick, we figured that k-grams (2-grams in this case) could help us sort words because we could automatically remove the need to edit k letters in a word. I think this will work, but there may be some more speed ups. |
| March 14 | 8:55-9:55am  | I began coding this version to work for finding the edit distance of all the words, which works but has explosive runtime. It mostly works, I need to work out a few kinks before it passes all the test cases. Once I get this done, I'll implement the input stream and begin working on a faster approach. |
